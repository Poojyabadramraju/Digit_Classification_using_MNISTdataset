# Digit_Classification_using_MNISTdataset
MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset of handwritten digits containing 60,000 handwritten digits for training a model and 10,000 handwritten digits for testing the model.
The dataset consists of 10 different classes in which the digit images are represented as 28*28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
This model is built on a simple neural network using Tensorflow and Keras.
